       Proper indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns

    5) Conversation Management
       - Maintain conversation context and state across multiple turns
       - Store conversation history per user
       - Context window management (last 10 messages)
       - Handle follow-up questions intelligently
       - Coreference resolution ("Add it to my calendar" - what is "it"?)

       - Ask for clarification when confidence is low
       - Support for spelling out words or phrases
       - Ambiguous requests: Smart disambiguation strategies
       - Ask clarifying questions
       - Present options when multiple interpretations exist
       - Use context to infer missing information
       - API unavailability: Graceful degradation
       - Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries max)
       - Fallback to cached data when possible
       - Queue failed operations for later retry
       - Clear user communication about service status
       - Network errors: Offline mode capabilities
       - Invalid input: Comprehensive input validation
       - Edge cases: Handle empty input, very long input, special characters

    7) Core Functionality Examples
       Schedule management:
       - "Schedule meeting with John at 3 PM tomorrow"
       - "Move my 2 PM meeting to 4 PM"
       - "Cancel all meetings on Friday"
       - "What meetings do I have this week?"
       - "Schedule a recurring standup every Monday at 9 AM"
       
       Task management:
       - "Add 'prepare presentation' to my todo list"
       - "What tasks are due today?"
       - "Mark the presentation task as complete"
       - "Set priority to high for the client proposal"
       - "Show me all tasks for the Marketing project"
       
       Calendar queries:
       - "What's on my calendar for today?"
       - "Am I free at 2 PM tomorrow?"
       - "When is my next meeting?"
       - "Show me all meetings with Sarah this month"
       
       Natural conversation:
       - Context awareness: "And what about Thursday?" (referring to previous calendar query)
       - Clarification: "Which John do you mean - John Smith or John Doe?"
       - Confirmation: "I've scheduled your meeting. Would you like me to send invites?"

    8) Technical Architecture
       - Modular design with clear separation of concerns:
         * AudioProcessor: Handle STT and TTS
         * IntentClassifier: NLP and intent recognition
         * ConversationManager: Context and state management
         * CalendarService: Calendar API integration
         * TaskService: Task API integration
         * DatabaseManager: Data persistence
         * AuthenticationManager: User auth and sessions
       - Dependency injection for easy testing and mocking
       - Configuration management via environment variables
       - Factory pattern for service instantiation
       - Strategy pattern for multiple API providers
       - Observer pattern for event handling
